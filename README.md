# [Podcast Summary With ChatGPT](https://podcast-summary-with-chatgpt.vercel.app?utm_source=github)

This project is to generate podcast episode summaries by using OpenAI and Deepgram.

## Running Locally

After cloning the repo, we need to create two API keys and put them in `.env` file.

- OPENAI_API_KEY: Apply it in [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- DEEPGRAM_API_KEY: Apply it in [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com).

Then, run the application in the command line and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
